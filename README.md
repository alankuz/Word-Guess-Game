once this is filled it will give you a win, with each letter press a _ is replaced with a letter that is correct and matches the answer word

Guesses remaining:

limit the amount of guesses that will go into the _ _ _ _ _ to only 12 once they go over 12 this will automatically make you lose the game and you will not be able to guess again.
